              The AK refers to a family of gas-operated, selective-fire rifles
              originally developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov.
              Known for reliability, simplicity, and mass production, the AK has
              become one of the most widely used small arms in modern history.

                The AK's design prioritized robustness and ease of maintenance
                over precisionâ€”traits that help explain its both state and
                non-state armed forces.
